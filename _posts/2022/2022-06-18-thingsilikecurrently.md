Recently I listened to [this podcast about identifying what you enjoy](https://open.spotify.com/episode/63uj0GgUn2pKikxiskvT4N?si=zr3lHHxGRPW0wuDWwXJlXg) and it inspired me to write down a few things I like at this present moment of being:

- [Catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for VSCode and Iterm
- Taking walks after dinner with my partner
- The song [I'm Not My Season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxfyRqF3e9s&ab_channel=FleetFoxes) by Fleet Foxes
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font because the ligatures are v nice
- [Altra Provision 6](https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/women/womens-provision-6-al0a5488?variationId=130) running shoes because they've got a wide toe box!
- Writing out my day-to-day in Notion (I go back between a digital planner and paper planner, currently it's a digital planner season for me)
- The sun rising at 5am. I'm a morning person and I like seeing the sky go between the pink, purple, to blue (ish, kinda mostly grey in Seattle)
- [Spotify's Blend Playlist](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-03-30/discover-and-listen-to-music-with-even-more-friends-and-family-plus-some-of-your-favorite-artists-with-spotifys-newest-blend-update/) feature.
- Brandon Weaver's series on [Understanding Ruby](https://dev.to/baweaver/series/11177). I haven't seriously programmed in Ruby in a hot minute and I'm falling in love with the language again ðŸ¥°
