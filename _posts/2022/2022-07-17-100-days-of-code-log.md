## Day 1: July 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I read Chapter 7 of [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/), learning about Equality of Values. I also started learning how to use Inkscape as well as how to animate SVGs with JavaScript and CSS.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy how interactive the reading is with Just JavaScript. Also, I can't help but notice how JS has so many quirks. For example, today I learned about the strict equality operator's special cases where `NaN === NaN` returns false and `0 === -0` returns true. What?!

Learning InkScape was not too difficult and pretty fun. I made a bat and I was prett happy with how it turned out. It's relatively easy to look things up for InkScape! The codepen I created was complaining about the SVG not being real HTML, and I learned it's because I had exported the image as an InkScape SVG instead of plain SVG, meaning it includes a few properties that are specific to InkScape and technically not HTML. I ended up keeping it as an InkScape SVG because without that type of export, the image didn't include the namespaces I was querying off of to select the pupils. I know I could add some selector classes off the plain SVG, but the effort was pretty manual so maybe I'll just do that next time ðŸ˜†

**Link to work**: My notes are private, but the codepen is [here](https://codepen.io/janessatran/pen/dymNgBQ).
