## Day 1: July 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I read Chapter 7 of [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/), learning about Equality of Values. I also started learning how to use Inkscape as well as how to animate SVGs with JavaScript and CSS.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy how interactive the reading is with Just JavaScript. Also, I can't help but notice how JS has so many quirks. For example, today I learned about the strict equality operator's special cases where `NaN === NaN` returns false and `0 === -0` returns true. What?!

Learning InkScape was not too difficult and pretty fun. I made a bat and I was prett happy with how it turned out. It's relatively easy to look things up for InkScape! The codepen I created was complaining about the SVG not being real HTML, and I learned it's because I had exported the image as an InkScape SVG instead of plain SVG, meaning it includes a few properties that are specific to InkScape and technically not HTML. I ended up keeping it as an InkScape SVG because without that type of export, the image didn't include the namespaces I was querying off of to select the pupils. I know I could add some selector classes off the plain SVG, but the effort was pretty manual so maybe I'll just do that next time ðŸ˜†

## Day 2: July 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Lots of reading today. I read Chapter 8 of [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/), about Properties. Also read [Fallacies of Distributed Systems](https://architecturenotes.co/fallacies-of-distributed-systems/) and [Things You Should Know About Databases](https://architecturenotes.co/things-you-should-know-about-databases/)

**Thoughts**: Not a ton of time to get into coding work but reading is still something!

The chapter on properties in the Just JavaScript book was really insightful in helping me realize the mental model I have around objects and properties. Again, I highly recommend this book! It's super interactive and helps you understand how you understand things, and helps you realize when your understanding of things might be a little wrong.

I enjoy how the Architecture Notes blog has a lot of visuals to supplement the articles. Sometimes I find the writing style a bit round-a-bout and distracting, but I learned a lot from it so far so that's what matters!

## Day 3: July 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read about Mutations in Chapter 9 of [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/). I also started going through a tutorial to learn about WebRTC, which stands for Web Real-Time Communication and is a technology that allows you to stream audio/video media between browsers without an intermediary!

**Thoughts**: The mutations chapter felt super reptitive, because it was really similar to the last chapter about properties. Nonetheless, the practice of drawing out how each line of code is visually represented was actually _super_ helpful. While I was very tempted to skip all the drawings, I am glad I stuck it through and completed the chapter because it seems to be helping me cement a more solid understanding of how properties and changing values of properties/objects works in the JS universe!

As for the WebRTC tutorial, I haven't gotten very far yet but I have learned a bit about WebRTC and how it works! I also learned a few new postgres commands and a bit more about databases!

**Link to work**: No links, maybe soon once I go through the WebRTC application tutorial ðŸ˜ƒ
