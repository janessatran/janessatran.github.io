Hello, again! As per usual, it has been a while since I have posted... but I am back with some exciting news. I've finally finished my rails application!! 😃🎉 I wanted to write about my journey and what I learned, so this blog post will be about just that! Hope you've all been well and thanks for following my journey! 


## How I did it
A little less than 2 months ago, I started going through Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) to learn Ruby on Rails. My evening's after work were spent reading through the chapters and building the sample application along with the book. I went through about half of the book before I realized this method of learning probably wasn't best for me. I felt like the information wasn't sticking as much, because I was building something straight out of a tutorial rather than having to struggle to find how to do something in the way I might if I were to build something from scratch (with no code to copy from a book/tutorial). So, I started over. I thought about an application that I wanted to make (which was surprisingly hard to do for me). I re-read the sections of the tutorial which covered the fundamentals (how to generate MVCs, migrations, etc). And I googled the rest that I didn't know how to do. 

## What I built
Inspired by some friends, I built a rails application called TIL notes, which stands for *Today I Learned*. The application can be viewed here: [https://tilnotes.herokuapp.com/](https://tilnotes.herokuapp.com/).

### Functionality
As a user of the rails application, one has the following capabilities: 
- Create, Edit, and Delete a cheatsheets
- Make your cheatsheet public or private
- Search cheatsheets by tag (only public cheatsheets are searchable)
- Favorite/unfavorite a cheatsheet
- Access a list of all your favorited cheatsheet
- Edit profile/settings, reset password
- View other users' profiles
- Follow/unfollow other users

## What I learned
This being my first real rails application, I learned a ton!!! I'll attempt to list what I learned below, but I may be forgetting to include a thing or two...

### Rails Things
- How to generate a model and controller
- How to generate a database migration
- How to reset, migrate, and seed the database to show fake data
- How to create templates using embedded Ruby
- How to create partials to use in views
- How to use persistent cookies to maintain state and remember users
- How to generate Action Mailer actions and views to send email
- How to use a generated token to create a unique URL to activate users
- How to identify users for password resets (hashed reset digest to identify valid reset requests)
- How to create an association between models (`has_many` and `belongs_to` methods in the Models)
- How to query for Active Record selections
- How to use Ajax to asynchronously send requests to the server without leaving the page (used in the following users and favoriting cheatsheet actions)

### Other Things
- How to practice Test-Driven Development / Behavior Driven Development
 - Write tests first to help predict course of development and document what is planned to be achieved in terms of test coverage.
 - Run tests that fail.
 - Write code to get the tests to pass.
- How to write requests specs with Rspec and the difference between request specs and controller specs
 - Request specs include full routing and are designed to drive behavior
- using Git to organize the project, creating new branches for different features, creating PRs (thanks to my friends who reviewed them!!), etc
- How to use FactoryBot to set up objects to test with
- How to use SimpleCov to track files and their coverage

## What's next?
As much as I would like to continue working on this rails application, I know that my time is best spent moving on to the next thing. What that is, I'm not exactly sure yet. I may continue to go through the rest of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) or I may sit down and study some Object Oriented Design Principles in Ruby... I suppose I will keep you posted once I figure it out. 

Thanks for reading! 💝
