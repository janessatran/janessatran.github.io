I" <p>Hello, reader! Itâ€™s been a bit of time since I last posted but I have nonetheless been coding away during the <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> challenge. 
In fact, Iâ€™m in my final week of the challenge ğŸ˜±. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve made it this far. I remember telling a friend when I first began the challenge and she looked at my wide-eyed and said â€œWow, really?â€
I was surprised by her response because honestly, when I first started the challenge I didnâ€™t put too much thought into it as a whole. 
I found The Odin Project and dediced to go from there, dedicating at least an hour a day to coding. Really, I was just trying to find a way to learn new things in programming because I realized I had been missing it a lot.
But now that Iâ€™m nearing the â€œendâ€â€¦ I am kind of shocked as well. Mostly, I am surprised by how much I can accomplish over such a short amount of time (relatively).
This is going to sound super cheesy, but I feel like the few hours Iâ€™ve dedicated after work to learning and improving on my programming skills is one of the best things Iâ€™ve ever done for myself.
Aside from developing my skills as a programmer, going through this challenge has helped me learn a lot about myself, connect with people from various corners of the world, and helped me find a community which I feel like I can be a part of (and want to be a part of- yay for Ruby!). (Ahhh so cheesy, I know. Iâ€™m not sorry though.)</p>
