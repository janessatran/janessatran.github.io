I"#<p>Hi, all! It has been a minute since I have posted, but I wanted to do a little update on what I have been up to! Through mid to end of 2018 I was quite busy welcoming lots of changes in my life and navigating unforeseen swerves. Most notably, I moved from Southern California to the Midwest (right on time for the Polar Vortex- yay!) and I also started a new job. The transition was surprisingly smooth and while it is freezing (I have not one, but TWO space heaters on my desk at work), I am embracing and enjoying the novelty of seasons.</p>
