I"S<p>Recently I listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/63uj0GgUn2pKikxiskvT4N?si=zr3lHHxGRPW0wuDWwXJlXg">this podcast about identifying what you enjoy</a> and it inspired me to write down a few things I like at this present moment of being:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin">Catppuccin theme</a> for VSCode and Iterm</li>
  <li>Taking walks after dinner with my partner</li>
  <li>The song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxfyRqF3e9s&amp;ab_channel=FleetFoxes">Iâ€™m Not My Season</a> by Fleet Foxes</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> font because the ligatures are v nice</li>

  <li>Writing out my day-to-day in Notion (I go back between a digital planner and paper planner, currently itâ€™s a digital planner season for me)</li>
  <li>The sun rising at 5am. Iâ€™m a morning person and I like seeing the sky go between the pink, purple, to blue (ish, kinda mostly grey in Seattle)</li>
