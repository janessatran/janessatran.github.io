I"‰<p>Visualizing data is one of my favorite parts of data analytics for many reasons. For one thing, I love how it lends itself well to a lot of creative exploration. I love thinking about the different ways to visualize data and putting myself in the shoes of someone who has never interacted with the information before to try to see how well it conveys the information. I love thinking about all the different possibilities of the color schemes, the chart or graph types, the ways to interact with the data. Clearly, the abundance of choice excites me and more so, the transformation of ostensibly meaningless numbers into something that is engaging and actionable does too! I may seem overly excited, but I genuinely love expressing myself creatively and if you are reading this, perhaps you understand because you are the same. 
With that said, I thought I would write up about a few of the many different data visualization tools that exist in Python because these are the tools that help us bring our visions to life! To begin, I will go over a 3 step process you can follow to improve your data visualization and then jump into the tools you can use.</p>
