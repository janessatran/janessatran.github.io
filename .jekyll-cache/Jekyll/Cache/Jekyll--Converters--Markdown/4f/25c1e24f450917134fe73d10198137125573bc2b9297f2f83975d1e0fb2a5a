I"±<p>One of my goals this year is to intentionally learn CSS. More specifically, Iâ€™d like to learn how to use CSS to make responsive web design, animations, and accessible websites. Recently I completed FreeCodeCampâ€™s Responsive Web Design course and completed the first project which involves making a tribute page. I made a tribute page for Elliot Smith, which you can <a href="https://janessatran.github.io/tributepage/">view here</a>. In this project, I utilized CSS Grid and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grid-template-areas</code> to make a responsive layout. In this post, I will describe how to set up a responsive layout using my project as an example.</p>
