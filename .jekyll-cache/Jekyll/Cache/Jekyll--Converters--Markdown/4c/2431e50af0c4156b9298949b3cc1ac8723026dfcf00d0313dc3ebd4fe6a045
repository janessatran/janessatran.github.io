<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Itâ€™s been about three months since Iâ€™ve posted on this blog, which is quite a bit of timeâ€¦ but not very unusual for me. I havenâ€™t prioritized recording the things Iâ€™ve been doing much in blog post form (although, Iâ€™m pretty good with <a href="https://twitter.com/janessatran_">tweeting</a> about what Iâ€™m learning). A lot has happened during the last time I posted! Exciting things! To name a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrapped up my apprenticeship with RubyMe, contributing to the open source project <a href="https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme">If me.</a></li>
  <li>I started learning ReactJS (in September), going through The Road to React and building <a href="https://protected-fortress-53041.herokuapp.com/">this HackerNews search app</a>) as well as <a href="https://janessatran.github.io/gratitude-list/">this Gratitude List app</a>).</li>
  <li>I adopted a kitten, his name is Lloyd.</li>
  <li>I got promoted at my current company- but Iâ€™m leaving soon because I got a Junior Software Engineering position!!!! (ahhh!!! yay!!)</li>
  <li>I started going to Meetups (my goal is at least once per month), which Iâ€™m proud of because I tend to have anxiety around traveling alone (I primarily transport by bus).</li>
  <li>I participated in Hacktoberfest and made 4 PRs in 4 different open source projects in ReactJS and Ruby on Rails!</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of working full-time, Iâ€™m pretty content with what Iâ€™ve been able to accomplish. Outside of coding and learning, Iâ€™m also trying to just maintain a balance in my life. I hear thatâ€™s a good thing (just kidding, I know first hand that itâ€™s a good thing, take care of yourselves folks!!!) To me, balance looks like spending quality time with friends and my partner, spending quality time with my cat, exercising a few times a week, and just giving myself the space to just reflect and refactor. So thereâ€™s been a lot of all that going on in between all the other milestones I just listed.</p>

<p>Anyway, Iâ€™m starting a new chapter soon and entering into the world of creating software professionally and I want to get in the habit of writing about what Iâ€™m learning/doing/confused about/etcetera, at least once a month. I think itâ€™d be nice to look back on old posts and see how far Iâ€™ve progressed, and hey, maybe it might help someone else too!</p>
