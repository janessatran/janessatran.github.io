<p>Last week was my first week working as a professional jr. software engineer and it was GREAT. I really like the people I work with, really enjoy working in Rails (I‚Äôm full-stack btw, Ruby just holds a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è), and I just love that I get to spend most of my days now thinking about code. I feel incredibly fortunate.</p>
