<p>Iâ€™ve recently been drawn to learning how to develop games. If you read <a href="/pursuitofjoy/">my post about 2021 being the Year of Joy</a>, you will know that my intention for this year is to pursue the things that bring about this feeling. Learning new things brings me joy (one of my top values in life is growth), and creating things that are fun and cute definitely bring me A LOT of joy.</p>
