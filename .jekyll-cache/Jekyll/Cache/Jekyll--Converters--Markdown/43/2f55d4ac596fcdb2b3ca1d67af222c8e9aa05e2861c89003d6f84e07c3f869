I"O<p>Today I started reading a book called “Rails AntiPatterns, Best Practice Ruby on Rails Refactoring”. My goal with reading this book is to  get a better sense of how to write more organized, clean code that makes sense to other people and is easier to maintain. In this post, I will share what I learned today from the book!</p>
