I"Û<p>Hi, friends! I thought itâ€™d be a good time to check in because Iâ€™m at half-way mark of the #100DaysOfCode challenge (I canâ€™t believe it!).
It has been a fun journey so far learning new programming skills, learning about myself, and learning about what progress I can make with consistent practice. 
As I continue this challenge, I now have a better idea of the skills I want to hone in on and generally how I plan to move forward with the challenege in general.</p>
