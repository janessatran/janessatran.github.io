I"æ<p>I recently read <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">a blog post on critter.blog about New Year Themes</a> and was inspired to pick a <em>theme</em> for this new year, instead of making the usual list of resolutions. I like this style a lot, particularly because it defines what you want to focus on without defining excatly how youâ€™ll accomplish it. I think this flexibility is crucial given the uncertainty of events in the world at this time.</p>
